North Somerset Council,http://opendatacommunities.org/id/unitary-authority/north-somerset,122,Burrington Combe,"Fine example of a typical Mendip gorge for walking, caving and climbing",Burrington Combe is a Carboniferous Limestone gorge near the village of Burrington on the north side of the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in North Somerset England. Combe or Coombe is a word of Celtic origin found in several forms on all of the British Isles denoting a steep sided valley or hollow. Burrington Combe is a gorge though the limestone hills although there is now no river running through it. Various cave entrances are exposed which have been occupied by humans for over 1000 years with a hillfort being built beside the combe in the Iron Age. The geology has led to a diversity of plant life. According to legend Augustus Montague Toplady was inspired to write the hymn Rock of Ages while sheltering under a rock in the combe although recent scholars have disputed this claim.,,Active and outdoors,,,Burrington Combe,,,,http://www.gps-routes.co.uk/routes/home.nsf/RoutesLinksWalks/burrington-combe-walking-route,http://www.mendiphillsaonb.org.uk/walks/,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,,Outdoors,,,,,,24142606,,,51.32775634,-2.752326977,,"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/@51.32775633665836,-2.7523269771047008,17z",Less than 15 minutes,134,Over 60 minutes,Yatton Railway Station,,,http://discovernorthsomerset.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/118-Burrington-Combe-2.jpg,,,Burrington-Combe
